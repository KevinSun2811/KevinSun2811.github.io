<br/>
I am Qizhang Sun, also known as Kevin. I am a behavioural scientist working at Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I study decision-making with behavioural experiments, process tracking (such as eye tracking and mouse tracking) and machine learning for predicting, assisting, and intervening individual decisions. These studies involve multiple interdisciplinary, such as psychology, information system, computer science, data science, industrial design, behavioural finance, and marketing, and apply to the fields such as decision support systems, human-computer natural interaction, large languge fine-tuned model, product design, consumer behaviour, behavioural finance, etc.
