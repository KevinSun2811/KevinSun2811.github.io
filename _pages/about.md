I am Qizhang Sun, also known as Kevin. I am a behavioural scientist working at Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I study decision-making and human-computer interaction with behavioural experiments, machine learning, LLMs and process-tracing methods (i.e., eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, aspect listing). The studiesâ€™ insights apply in AI learning algorithm, explainable AI, decision support system, product design, consumer behaviour and investment behaviour. My ongoing projects focus on both psy4ai and ai4psy.
