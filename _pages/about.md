I am Qizhang Sun, also known as Kevin. I am a behavioural scientist working at Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I study decision-making and huamn-computer interaction with behavioural experiments, machine learning, LLMs and process-tracing methods (i.e., eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, aspect listing). The studies' insights apply in AI learning algrorithm, explanable AI, decision support system, product design, cusumer behaviour and investment behaviourl. My ongoing projects focus on both psy4ai and ai4psy.
